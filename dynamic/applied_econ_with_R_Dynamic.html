<h2>Welcome!</h2>
<p>Hi!</p>
<p>This tutorial is written for Applied Economics students at the University of Bristol.</p>
<p><strong>How this works</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The tutorial is structured as a complete research project starting with loading the raw data and ending with a chart comparing the estimates across approaches.</li>
<li>The tutorial aims at covering the same methods we covered in Stata during the term.</li>
<li>All data used is directly downloadable. You should therefore be able to download the data and try the methods in R on your own computer.</li>
<li>The tutorial mainly consists of code blocks and the resulting output. Every now and then I include some references to how I would do the same task in Stata or key differences to Stata.</li>
</ul>
<p>I appreciate feedback, thanks.</p>

<div id="section-research-question-data" class="section level2">
<h2>1 Research question &amp; data</h2>
<p>You will only see the above content in the output.</p>
<div id="section-the-research-question" class="section level3">
<h3>1.1 The research question</h3>
<p>Our goal is to answer the following <strong>fictitious</strong> research question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does attending a summer school improve test scores?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The research question will be addressed using a <strong>fictitious simulated</strong> dataset.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-the-fictitious-setting" class="section level3">
<h3>1.2 The fictitious setting</h3>
<p>The research question is inspired by papers such as <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407607001194?casa_token=hnnF764CKPoAAAAA:5b9WhCManNDsdW4SmOHnnzNr0fZIarW8s6EsvpQW7MdUt470eNPmN2T8IFCsNc6Iajew5tEeNA">Matsudaira (2007)</a> and the survey on interventions for low SES students by by <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/0034654316687036">Dietrichson et al ( 2017)</a>.</p>
<p>The <strong>fictitious</strong> setting is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the summer break between year 5 and year 6, (roughly corresponding to age 10) there is an optional summer school.</li>
<li>The summer school could be focusing on the school curriculum, or it could be focused on skills that lead to improved schooling outcomes (for example “grit” as in <a href="https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/134/3/1121/5342089?redirectedFrom=fulltext">Alan et al (2019)</a>).</li>
<li>The summer school is free, but enrollment requires active involvement by parents.</li>
<li>We are interested in whether participation in the summer school improves child outcomes.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="section-the-fictitious-data" class="section level3">
<h3>1.3 The fictitious data</h3>
<p>We have three datasets to study the research question:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hhsievertsen/applied_econ_with_r/main/data/school_data_1.csv">school_data_1.csv</a></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>We use this as example on how to <strong>load data stored in a csv format</strong>.</li>
<li>This dataset contains information about person id, school id, an indicator variable that takes the value of 1 if the individual participated in the summer school, information about gender, parental income and parental schooling, and test scores in year 5 (before the treatment) and year 6.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><a href="https://github.com/hhsievertsen/applied_econ_with_r/raw/main/data/school_data_2.dta">school_data_2.dta</a></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>We use this as example on <strong>how to load data stored in Stata format</strong>.</li>
<li>This dataset contains information about person id, which enables us to link it to the first dataset. We will use this to practice <strong>merging</strong> data.</li>
<li>The dataset also contains information about whether the individual received a reminder letter.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><a href="https://github.com/hhsievertsen/applied_econ_with_r/raw/main/data/school_data_3.xlsx">school_data_3.xlsx</a></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>We use this as example on how to <strong>load data stored in a Microsoft Excel format</strong>.</li>
<li>This dataset contains information about person id, which enables us to link it to the first dataset.</li>
<li>The dataset also contains information about test scores in earlier (&lt;5) and later years (&gt;6).</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s get started!</p>

<h2>2 Loading &amp; merging the data</h2>
<div id="section-installing-and-loading-a-package" class="section level3">
<h3>2.1 Installing and loading a “package”</h3>
<p>The first item on our to do list is to load the datasets. The first dataset is in a csv format. There are several ways to load a csv document into R. I am going to use <code>read_csv()</code> from the <em>readr</em> package. Before we can use this package we need to install it. We install a package with the <code>install.packages()</code> function, where we insert the name of the package in parenthesis. This procedure corresponds to <em>ssc install outreg</em> to install outreg in Stata.</p>
<p>An important difference to Stata is that we also have to tell R to use the new package in every new session. We do that with <code>library()</code>. However we only have to install it once. So to install and load <em>readr</em> we run the following command:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(&quot;readr&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>To load the <em>readr</em> package we run the following command:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(&quot;readr&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>While we only have to install a package once on each computer, we have load it in every new session.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-loading-a-csv-data-file" class="section level3">
<h3>2.2 Loading a csv data file</h3>
<p>Having installed <em>readr</em> we are now ready to use the <code>read_csv()</code> function to load our first dataset. We will load the dataset <em>school_data_1.csv</em> by inserting the path to the file in the parenthesis. In the example below we first load the <em>readr</em> package to illustrate that we have to load it in every new session. However, in later code blocks we’ll leave out the <code>library()</code> call for packages that have already been loaded.</p>
<p>PS. note also that we include comments in code block below. Comments are lines that R ignores and these lines always start with a <code>#</code> symbol.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># load readr package

<p>Stata users would now expect that the dataset is loaded in the memory and everything I do now relates to this dataset. Stata users will be disappointed. When R executes the command above it loads the data, but then it says: “Hey, Hans didn’t tell me what to do with the dataset, so I will just print the contents of it and forget it.”</p>
<p>While Stata (at least in older versions) is based on having one dataset loaded at a time, we can have many datasets loaded at once in R. Therefore, to identify the dataset we need to give it a name. In this example we tell R to store the new dataset under the name <em>school_data_1</em> we use the <em>assignment operator</em> <code>&lt;-</code>, but <code>=</code> would also work. However, it is a good habit to use the assignment operator, because it makes life a bit easier in more advanced situations that will meet later on your R journey (not in this tutorial).</p>
<pre class="r"><code># load data and assign it to an object with the name school_data_1
school_data_1&lt;-read_csv(&quot;C:/Users/hhs/school_data_1.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>In Stata my first step after loading the data is typically to use <em>browse</em> to take a look at the data. In R we can do that with <code>View(school_data_1)</code>. I will not show that command here. Instead I will present the function <code>head()</code> that prints the head of the dataset with the first 6 rows.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Use head() to print first 6 observations of school_data_1
head(school_data_1)</code></pre>

<h3>2.5 Merging the datasets</h3>
<p>Let’s now merge the three datasets. We will use the <code>merge()</code> function for that. In merge we first state the names of the two datasets to merge. We then tell R the column(s) to use to merge the two datasets with <code>by=....</code>. As a default R includes all rows that are observed in both datasets (based on the by variable), but we can set <code>all=TRUE</code> to keep all rows from both datasets, or <code>all.x=TRUE</code> to keep all rows from the first dataset and all rows that were merged, and finally <code>all.y=TRUE</code> to keep all rows from the second dataset. The default behaviour of R corresponds to using the option <em>keep(3)</em> in Stata, and Stata’s default option corresponds to using <code>all=TRUE</code> in R.</p>
<p>Here as example where merge the first two datasets. We then use the <code>dim()</code> function to get the dimensions of the new merged dataset in terms of the number of rows and the number of columns.</p>
<p>And hey, this is the first dynamic code block. You can edit the code (there is no need in this case) and click Run Code to see what happens.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="ch2-9b" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">

<pre class="text"><code># dimensions of school_data_1
dim(school_data_1)</code></pre>
</div>
<p>We note that the merged dataset has 3491 rows and 9 columns. We actually didn’t check the number of rows in the raw datasets (that would have been a good thing to do; maybe you can do it by changing the code above?). If all rows are merged we should have the same number of rows as in the original dataset. From above we knew that <em>school_data_1</em> has 8 columns and by merging the <em>school_data_2</em> on we also get the column with the information about whether the family receiving the letter, making it to in total 9 columns.</p>
<p><strong>Important difference to Stata:</strong> A key difference between Stata and R merge is that in case a variable in the first dataset has the same name as a column in the second dataset, R will automatically rename the column names by adding suffices <em>.x</em> (the column from the first dataset) and <em>.y</em> (the column from the second dataset). Stata just overwrites the columns.</p>
<p>Now it is your turn, in the block below we want o</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Merge <em>school_data_1</em> and <em>school_data_2</em> by the <em>person_id</em> column and save the merged dataset under the name <em>school_data</em>.</li>
<li>Merge <em>school_data_3</em> with <em>school_data</em> and overwrite <em>school_data</em>. Note in this case we merge by <em>person_id</em> and <em>school_id</em> columns. This is not necessary (because person_id is unique), but serves as an example on how to merge by more columns using <code>c()</code>. name <em>school_data</em>.</li>
<li>Use the <code>summary()</code> function to obtain summary statistics of the variables.</li>

<h3>3.1 Tidying the data</h3>
<p>Now that we have merged the datasets, we want to make sure that the merged dataset satisfies the <a href="https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf">Tidy Data Principles</a>. From these principles we know that the number of columns should correspond to the number of variables in the dataset. But how many variables are there?</p>
<p><div class="panel-heading tutorial-quiz-title">Quiz</div></p>

<div id="quiz-1-action_button_container" class="shiny-html-output"></div>
<script>if (Tutorial.triggerMathJax) Tutorial.triggerMathJax()</script>
</div>
</div>
<p>Let’s now compare the number of variables to the number of columns:</p>

<pre class="text"><code># Alternatively we can use the nrow() functions to get the number of columns
ncol(school_data_merged)</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Oh no! The number of columns does not correspond to the number of variables. Let’s sort this out. The issue is that the variables <em>test_year_5</em> contain information about the test score and the year. We need to separate this out. We can use tools from the <em>tidyr</em> package to make the dataset tidy. Specifically, we use <code>pivot_longer()</code> which corresponds to <em>reshape long</em> in Stata. See also section 9.2 in the <a href="https://hhsievertsen.shinyapps.io/r_introduction/">R introduction</a> for details.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># load tidyr package
library(&quot;tidyr&quot;)
# make data tidy (make long)
school_data_tidy&lt;-school_data_merged%&gt;%
       pivot_longer(
         cols = starts_with(&quot;test_year&quot;),
         names_to = &quot;year&quot;,
         names_prefix = &quot;test_year_&quot;,
         names_transform = list(year = as.integer),
         values_to = &quot;test_score&quot;,
       )
# ncol to get the number of columns of the new dataset
ncol(school_data_merged)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 17</code></pre>
<p>Hurray! We now have a dataset where the number columns correspond to the number of variables.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-sample-selection" class="section level3">
<h3>3.2 Sample Selection</h3>
<p>We now have a dataset that satisfies the tidy data principles. The next task before is the sample selection. The only sample selection we are concerned with in this exercise is missing values. We will use the <code>skim()</code> function to assess how many missing values there are in our dataset. <code>skim()</code> is one of my favourite functions in R to get an overview of the datasets, it comes from the <em>skimr</em> package.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="ch3-3" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code># Load skimr
library(&quot;skimr&quot;)
# Use skim() to skim the data
skim(school_data_tidy)</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-opts-chunk="1">{"fig.width":6.5,"fig.height":4,"fig.retina":2,"fig.align":"default","fig.keep":"high","fig.show":"asis","out.width":624,"warning":true,"error":false,"message":true,"exercise.df_print":"paged","exercise.checker":"NULL"}</script>
</div>
<p>We can easily observe how many rows and columns there are, the variable types, the number of missing values. The mean, standard deviations, percentiles, and we even get a small histogram.</p>
<p>We observe that the column <em>parental_schooling</em> has 45 missing values and the variable <em>test_score</em> has 11 missing values. Let’s assume that these values are missing at random and remove these rows. Here we use <code>filter()</code> for that. The <code>filter()</code> function takes two arguments. First, the name of the original dataset, and secondly the condition a row must satisfy to be kept in the filtering process. The condition we want to satisfy is that <code>!is.na(parental_schooling)</code>. The <code>is.na()</code> is a function is true if the element in <code>( )</code> is missing. We use the <code>!</code> to achieve the opposite of that. In other words that parental schooling is not missing.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="ch3-4" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code># Select only rows with no missing values
school_data_selected&lt;-filter(school_data_tidy,!is.na(parental_schooling),!is.na(test_score))
# Use skim() to skim the data again
skim(school_data_selected)</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-opts-chunk="1">{"fig.width":6.5,"fig.height":4,"fig.retina":2,"fig.align":"default","fig.keep":"high","fig.show":"asis","out.width":624,"warning":true,"error":false,"message":true,"exercise.df_print":"paged","exercise.checker":"NULL"}</script>
</div>
<p>Very good! We’ve now created a new dataset containing only complete cases. Let’s now create a nice looking table.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-modifying-the-data" class="section level3">
<h3>3.3 Modifying the data</h3>
<p>Our next step is to make some modifications to the data. First, we will rename the <em>summercamp</em> variable to <em>summerschool</em>. We do that with the <code>rename()</code> function. The <code>rename()</code> function has a similar syntax to filter. We first state the name of the original dataset and then the rename expression.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="ch3-5" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code># rename summercamp to summerschool

# use head to view the first 6 observations 
head(analysisdata)</code></pre>

</div>
<p>Brilliant. In the next step we want to transform our <em>test_score</em> variable to have mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. Importantly we want to do this standardization within year. In Stata this would be a task for <em>bys year:</em>. In Stata we first specify what variable to group the data on, and the apply the functions <em>sd</em> and <em>mean</em> on that level.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="ch3-6" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code># Standardize test score
# Group analysisdata by year
analysisdata&lt;-group_by(analysisdata,year)
# Create a new variable with mutate
analysisdata&lt;-mutate(analysisdata, test_score=(test_score-mean(test_score))/sd(test_score))
# show mean of test_score
print(paste(&quot;Mean of test score:&quot;,mean(analysisdata$test_score)))
#show sd of test_score
print(paste(&quot;SD of test score:&quot;,sd(analysisdata$test_score)))</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-opts-chunk="1">{"fig.width":6.5,"fig.height":4,"fig.retina":2,"fig.align":"default","fig.keep":"high","fig.show":"asis","out.width":624,"warning":true,"error":false,"message":true,"exercise.df_print":"paged","exercise.checker":"NULL"}</script>
</div>
<p>In the example above we use</p>
<ul>
<li><code>print()</code> to print output to the console (just like <em>display</em> in Stata).</li>
<li><code>paste()</code> to concatenate elements together</li>
<li><code>analysisdata$test_score</code> to extract the variable <em>test_score</em> from the <em>analysisdata</em> dataset.</li>
<li><code>mean()</code> and <code>sd()</code> to calculate means and standard deviations. Note that this only works because we already removed the missing values. If we apply <code>mean()</code> on a vector that includes missing values it will return a missing value unless we specify the option <code>na.rm = FALSE</code>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-descriptive-statistics" class="section level2">
<h2>4 Descriptive Statistics</h2>
<p>We’ve now managed to load <em>csv</em>, <em>dta</em>, and <em>xlsx</em> files. We’ve also managed to merge them, restructure the dataset, and we have removed missing values. The next step in our empirical project is to create some tables and charts to describe the dataset.</p>
<p>Our goal is to create a table that shows means, standard deviations, and other statistics that gives us and the reader an impression of the dataset. We already know at least two ways to calculate summary statistics:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><code>summary()</code> from base R. This function actually works on a lot of object types in R. It always gives a good summary. But our goal is to create a table that we can include in a Microsoft Word or Latex document.</p></li>
<li><p><code>skim()</code> from the <em>skimr</em> package.</p></li>
</ol>
<div id="section-a-quick-way-to-create-a-nice-looking-table" class="section level3">
<h3>4.1 A quick way to create a nice looking table</h3>
<p>We will first use a cousin of <code>skim()</code> to create a table with summary statistics that can be exported to various formats, included Latex. The cousin comes from the <em>modelsummary</em> package and is called <code>datasummary_skim()</code>. Let’s first create the default table:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="ch4-1" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code># load modelsummary
library(&quot;modelsummary&quot;)
# create a summary stat table
analysisdata%&gt;%
  filter(year==2)%&gt;%
  select(female,starts_with(&quot;paren&quot;),letter,summerschool,test_score)%&gt;%
  datasummary_skim()</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-opts-chunk="1">{"fig.width":6.5,"fig.height":4,"fig.retina":2,"fig.align":"default","fig.keep":"high","fig.show":"asis","out.width":624,"warning":true,"error":false,"message":true,"exercise.df_print":"paged","exercise.checker":"NULL"}</script>
</div>
<p>Let’s change the appearance of the table and export it to Word. When exporting it to Latex, we can’t have histogram’, so we disable them. We specify <code>output="docx"</code> to write to a Word file. We can also export the table to other formats like LaTex.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># load modelsummary
library(&quot;modelsummary&quot;)
# create a summary stat table in Latex format
analysisdata%&gt;%
  filter(year==2)%&gt;%
  select(female,starts_with(&quot;paren&quot;),letter,summerschool,test_score)%&gt;%
  datasummary_skim( fmt=&quot;%.2f&quot;,
                 histogram=FALSE, output=&quot;tab_summary_statistics.docx&quot;)</code></pre>

<h3>4.2 Custom tables</h3>
<p>To customize our table of summary statistics a bit more we can use the function <code>datasummary()</code> (from the modelsummary package, but we have already loaded that1). This function allows us to enter a <em>formula</em> for the structure of our table. Try running the code below and try also to make a change to also include the 75th percentile and to include the <em>parental_lincome</em> variable.</p>

<li><p>Use the formula <code>Factor(summerschool)*(Mean+SD)</code> to show that we want to show the mean and standard deviation separately for each values of the variable <code>summerschool</code>. We use <code>Factor()</code> to tell R that it should consider summerschool as a binary variable. We could also have done that in the data tidying process. We can also reverse the ordering <code>(Mean+SD)*Factor(summerschool)</code>, which would then first show the mean and standard deviation and then split by summerschool within these values.</p></li>

<h3>4.3 Variable names in tables</h3>
<p>So far we’ve used variable names as labels in our table. In contrast to Stata, R allows for labels with white space, and we could therefore rename the variables to give nicer looking names in our table. However, we can also just assign a “label” when creating the table as shown below:</p>

<h2>5 Descriptive charts</h2>
<p>The <em>ggplot</em> world is covered in detail in <a href="https://hhsievertsen.shinyapps.io/r_introduction_UoB_2/">R introduction</a>, but let us briefly cover a few charts here as well. You will also see more charts in later chapters.</p>
<div id="section-a-scatter-plot" class="section level3">
<h3>5.1 A scatter plot</h3>
<p>Our first chart is a scatter plot. We are interested in whether test score and parental income are correlated. We therefore create a scatter plot of test scores in year 5 against parental income. We add a fitted line as well.</p>
<p>In the following example we</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Initiate a <code>ggplot()</code> object using the <em>analysisdata</em> filtered to only include year 5.</li>
<li>Specify that <em>parental_lincome</em> should be used on the x-axis and <em>test_score</em> on the y-axis in <code>aes()</code> inside <code>ggplot()</code>.</li>
<li>Use <code>geom_smooth()</code> to include a fitted line.</li>
<li>Use <code>geom_point()</code> to add the scatters.</li>
</ol>
<p>This chart does not look very good. You can use the tools from the <a href="https://hhsievertsen.shinyapps.io/r_introduction_UoB_2/">R introduction</a> to polish it (or you can use the hints to get some suggestions).</p>

<h3>5.2 Bar chart and boxplot</h3>
<p>Okay, we observe that test score is correlated with parental income. That is not surprising. Now let’s also create charts to assesses whether summer school attendance is correlated with individual characteristics. We first create a scatter plot of parental schooling and test scores in year 5 (before the summer school). This is just like above, but with schooling instead of income. Secondly, we create a bar chart showing average test score in year 5 (before the summer school) by summer school attendance. Thirdly, we create box plots of parental income by summer school attendance. There are a few additional tricks in the following code:</p>
<ul>
<li>We first create the basic <code>ggplot()</code> object where we load the data and specify the theme. This object is called <em>rawchart</em></li>
<li>We then create 3 charts based on <em>rawchart</em>. Each chart is saved under a name.</li>
<li>We use <code>geom_bar()</code> to create a bar chart. We set <code>stat="summary",fun="mean"</code> to tell R to create a bar chart showing the mean of <em>test_score</em>.</li>
<li>We use <code>labs()</code> to specify the axes titles.</li>
<li>We use <code>geom_boxplot()</code> to create a box plot.</li>
<li>We use the patchwork package to combine several charts in one chart.</li>
<li>Use <code>ggsave()</code> to save the chart to a <em>png</em> file.</li>
</ul>

<p>The three charts above show us that test scores are correlated with parental background (the scatter plot), that those who attended the summer school had better test scores before the summer school, and that parental account is correlated with summer school attendance (the box plot). In short:</p>

<p>The next chart is inspired by a Joy Division album cover unknown pleasures (read more <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/sa-visual/pop-culture-pulsar-origin-story-of-joy-division-s-unknown-pleasures-album-cover-video/">here</a>). We use <code>geom_density_ridges()</code> from the <em>ggridges</em> package.</p>
<p>Our goal is to compare the test score distribution for those who received the summer school reminder letter with those who did not. We are already making a step into the next chapter and assessing at the Randomized Control Trial in two dimensions. First, the test score comparisons before year 6 are informative about whether the randomization worked. Secondly, the test score comparisons from year 6 and later are informative about the reduced form effect.</p>

<p>The chart above tells a convincing story. In the first five years the distribution of test scores is essentially identical across those who received and those who did not receive a reminder letter. That indicates that the randomisation worked as intended. After year 5 the test score distribution of those who received a reminder letter shifted to the right compared to those who did not receive a letter suggesting a reduced form effect of the letter on our outcome. Let’s analyse that in the next sections.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-balancing-tables" class="section level2">
<h2>6 Balancing tables</h2>
<p>The last chart suggested that the letter that was randomly sent to some families to remind them about the summer school worked. The test score distribution of the children that received the letter shifted to the right. Importantly, the charts also suggested that there was no difference prior to the summer school. Let us now test that formally.</p>
<div id="section-pairwise-t-test" class="section level3">
<h3>6.1 Pairwise t-test</h3>
<p>We can conduct a t-test in R using <code>t.test()</code>. Specifically, we specify the formula <code>test_score~summerschool</code> to test whether the mean <em>test_score</em> is significantly different across the two groups specified by <em>summerschool</em>. Let’s do that for year 5 data:</p>

<p>One feature of R that I really appreciate (especially compared to Stata) is that I can skip steps and directly insert functions within other functions. For example if I know that I am not going to use the selected dataset again, we don’t need to create it first. We can simply specify the selection criteria in the data argument of <code>t.test()</code> as shown by the hints to the code block above, where we use year 4 instaed of year 5.</p>
