## Welcome!

Hi!


This tutorial is written for Applied Economics students at the University of Bristol.


**How this works**

- There are two tutorials. This one is the **dynamic** version. To try the **static** version go to: [hhsievertsen.github.io/applied_econ_with_r/](https://hhsievertsen.github.io/applied_econ_with_r/) (the cover the same material).
- The tutorial aims at covering the same methods we covered in Stata during the term.
- All data used is directly downloadable. You should therefore be able to download the data and try the methods in R on your own computer. 
- The tutorial mainly consists of code blocks  and the resulting output.  Every now and then I include some references to how I would do the same task in Stata or key differences to Stata. 

I appreciate feedback, thanks.

## 1 Research question  & data


You will only see the above content in the output.


### 1.1 The research question

Our goal is to answer the following **fictitious** research question:
  
> Does attending a summer school improve test scores?
  
The research question will be addressed using a **fictitious simulated** dataset. 

### 1.2 The fictitious setting

The research question is inspired by papers such as [Matsudaira (2007)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407607001194?casa_token=hnnF764CKPoAAAAA:5b9WhCManNDsdW4SmOHnnzNr0fZIarW8s6EsvpQW7MdUt470eNPmN2T8IFCsNc6Iajew5tEeNA) and the survey on interventions for low SES students by  by [Dietrichson et al ( 2017)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/0034654316687036). 

The  **fictitious** setting is as follows:
  
- In the summer break between year 5 and year 6, (roughly corresponding to age 10) there is an optional summer school. 
- The  summer school  could be focusing on the school curriculum, or it could be focused on skills that lead to improved schooling outcomes (for example "grit" as in [Alan et al (2019)](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/134/3/1121/5342089?redirectedFrom=fulltext)).
- The summer school is free, but enrollment requires active involvement by parents.
- We are interested in whether participation in the summer school improves child outcomes. 



### 1.3  The fictitious data

We have three datasets to study the research question:
  
1.  [school_data_1.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hhsievertsen/applied_econ_with_r/main/data/school_data_1.csv) 

- We use this as example on how to **load data stored in a csv format**.
- This dataset contains information about person id, school id, an indicator variable that takes the value of 1 if the individual participated in the summer school, information about gender, parental income and parental schooling, and test scores in year 5 (before the treatment) and year 6. 


2.  [school_data_2.dta](https://github.com/hhsievertsen/applied_econ_with_r/raw/main/data/school_data_2.dta) 

- We use this as example on **how to load data stored in Stata format**.
- This dataset contains information about person id, which enables us to link it to the first dataset. We will use this to practice **merging** data.
- The dataset also contains information about whether the individual received a reminder letter. 


3.  [school_data_3.xlsx](https://github.com/hhsievertsen/applied_econ_with_r/raw/main/data/school_data_3.xlsx) 

- We use this as example on how to **load data stored in a Microsoft Excel format**.
- This dataset contains information about person id, which enables us to link it to the first dataset. 
- The dataset also contains information about test scores in earlier (<5) and later years (>6).


Let's get started!

<br><br><br><br><br><br>


## 2 Loading & merging the data


### 2.1 Installing and loading a "package"

The first item on our to do list is to load the datasets. The first dataset is in a csv format. There are several ways to load a csv document into R. I am going to use `read_csv()` from the *readr* package. Before we can use this package we need to install it. We install a package with the `install.packages()` function, where we insert the name of the package in parenthesis. This procedure corresponds to *ssc install outreg* to install outreg in Stata. 

An important difference to Stata is that we also have to tell R to use the new package in every new session. We do that with `library()`. However we only have to install it once. So to install and load *readr* we run the following command:

```{r ch2-1,eval=F, include=T,echo=T}
install.packages("readr")
```

To load the *readr* package we run the following command:

```{r ch2-2,eval=F, include=T,echo=T}
library("readr")
```

While we only have to install a package once on each computer, we have load it in every new session. 

### 2.2 Loading a csv data file 

Having installed *readr* we are now ready to use the `read_csv()` function to load our first dataset. We will load the dataset *school_data_1.csv* by inserting the path to the file in the parenthesis. In the example below we first load the *readr* package to illustrate that we have to load it in every new session. However, in later code blocks we'll leave out the `library()` call for packages that have already been loaded.

PS. note also that we include comments in code block below. Comments are lines that R ignores and these lines always start with a `#` symbol.

```{r ch2-3,eval=F, include=T,echo=T, out.width=500,fig.align="center"}
# load readr package
library("readr")
# load data
read_csv("C:/Users/hhs/school_data_1.csv")
```
```{r ch2-3a,eval=T, include=T,echo=F, out.width=500,fig.align="center"}
print(school_data_1)
```



Stata users would now expect that the dataset is loaded in the memory and everything I do now relates to this dataset. Stata users will be disappointed. When R executes the command above it loads the data, but then it says: "Hey, Hans didn't tell me what to do with the dataset, so I will just print the contents of it and forget it." 

While Stata (at least in older versions) is based on having one dataset loaded at a time, we can have many datasets loaded at once in R. Therefore, to identify the dataset we need to give it a name. In this example we tell R to store the new dataset under the name *school_data_1* we use the *assignment operator* `<-`, but `=` would also work. However, it is a good habit to use the assignment operator, because it makes life a bit easier in more advanced situations that will meet later on your R journey (not in this tutorial). 


```{r ch2-4,eval=F, include=T,echo=T, out.width=500,fig.align="center"}
# load data and assign it to an object with the name school_data_1
school_data_1<-read_csv("C:/Users/hhs/school_data_1.csv")
```

In Stata my first step after loading the data is typically to use *browse* to take a look at the data. In R we can do that with `View(school_data_1)`. I will not show that command here. Instead I will present the function `head()` that prints the head of the dataset with the first 6 rows. 

```{r ch2-5,eval=T, include=T,echo=T, out.width=500,fig.align="center"}
# Use head() to print first 6 observations of school_data_1
head(school_data_1)
```

### 2.3 Loading a Stata data file 

We will now load a Stata dataset into R. To load a *dta* file I will use the  `read.dta13()` function from the *readstata13* package. The syntax is then very similar to the `read_csv()` syntax. This time we will use `tail()` to show the last 8 observations.


```{r ch2-6,eval=F, include=T,echo=T}
# load readstata13
library("readstata13")
# use read.dta13 from readstata13 to load a Stata dataset
school_data_2<- read.dta13("C:/Users/hhs/school_data_2.dta")
# print the 8 rows in the tail
tail(school_data_2,n=8)
```
```{r ch2-7,eval=T, include=T,echo=F}
tail(school_data_2,n=8)
```


  
### 2.4 Loading an xlsx file

Finally, we'll load the the *xlsx* file *school_data_3.xlsx* for that we'll use the `read.xlsx()` function from the *openxlsx* package. Again, the syntax is very similar to what we've seen before.  This time we will use the `glimpse()` function from the *dplyr* package to get a glimpse of the dataset. 


```{r ch2-8,eval=F, include=T,echo=T}
# Load openxlsx and dplyr
library("openxlsx")
library("dplyr")
# Use read.xlsx from openxlsx to load .xlsx file
school_data_3 <- read.xlsx("C:/Users/hhs/school_data_3.xlsx")
# use glimpse to get a "glimpse" of the loaded dataset
glimpse(school_data_3)
```
```{r ch2-9,eval=T, include=T,echo=F}

glimpse(school_data_3)
```


### 2.5 Merging the datasets

Let's now merge the three datasets. We will use the `merge()` function for that. In merge we first state the names of the two datasets to merge. We then tell R the column(s) to use to merge the two datasets with `by=....`. As a default R includes all rows that are observed in both datasets (based on the by variable), but we can  set `all=TRUE` to keep all rows from both datasets, or `all.x=TRUE` to keep all rows from the first dataset and all rows that were merged, and finally `all.y=TRUE` to keep all rows from the second dataset. The default behaviour of R corresponds to using the option *keep(3)* in Stata, and Stata's default option corresponds to using `all=TRUE` in R. 

Here as example where merge the first two datasets. We then use the `dim()` function to get the dimensions of the new merged dataset in terms of the number of rows and the number of columns. 

And hey, this is the first dynamic code block. You can edit the code (there is no need in this case) and click Run Code to see what happens. 

```{r ch2-9b,exercise=TRUE}
# merge school_data_1 with school_data_2
school_data_merged<-merge(school_data_1,school_data_2,by="person_id")
dim(school_data_merged)
```
```{r ch2-9b-hint-1}
# dimensions of school_data_1
dim(school_data_1)
```

We note that the merged dataset has 3491 rows and 9 columns. We actually didn't check the number of rows in the raw datasets (that would have been a good thing to do; maybe you can do it by changing the code above?). If all rows are merged we should have the same number of rows as in the original dataset.  From above we knew that *school_data_1* has 8 columns and by merging the *school_data_2* on we also get the column with the information about whether the family receiving the letter, making it to in total 9 columns. 


**Important difference to Stata:** A key difference between Stata and R merge is that in case a variable in the first dataset has the same name as a column in the second dataset, R will automatically rename the column names by adding suffices *.x* (the column from the first dataset) and *.y*  (the column from the second dataset). Stata just overwrites the columns. 

Now it is your turn, in the block below we want to 

1. Merge *school_data_1* and *school_data_2* by the *person_id* column and save the merged dataset under the name *school_data*.
2. Merge *school_data_3* with *school_data* and overwrite *school_data*. Note in this case we merge by *person_id* and *school_id* columns. This is not necessary (because person_id is unique), but serves as an example on how to merge by more columns using `c()`.  name *school_data*.
3. Use the `summary()` function to obtain summary statistics of the variables.


```{r ch2-10,exercise=TRUE}
# Merge school_data_1 and school_data_2 and save as school_data_merged

# Merge school_data_3 with school_data_merged

# summary statistics

```
```{r ch2-10-hint-1}
# Merge school_data_1 and school_data_2 and save as school_data_merged 
school_data_merged<-merge(school_data_1,school_data_2,by="person_id")
```
```{r ch2-10-hint-2}
# Merge school_data_1 and school_data_2 and save as school_data_merged 
school_data_merged<-merge(school_data_1,school_data_2,by="person_id")
# Merge school_data_3 with school_data_merged
school_data_merged<-merge(school_data_merged,school_data_3,by=c("person_id","school_id"))
```
```{r ch2-10-hint-3}
# Merge school_data_1 and school_data_2 and save as school_data_merged 
school_data_merged<-merge(school_data_1,school_data_2,by="person_id")
# Merge school_data_3 with school_data_merged
school_data_merged<-merge(school_data_merged,school_data_3,by=c("person_id","school_id"))
# summary statistics
summary(school_data_merged)
```

## 3 Cleaning the data

### 3.1 Tidying the data

Now that we have merged the datasets,  we want to make sure that the merged dataset satisfies the  [Tidy Data Principles](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf). From these principles we know that the number of columns should correspond to the number of variables in the dataset. But how many variables are there?

```{r quiz}
quiz(
  question("How many variables does the merged dataset contain",
    answer("7"),
    answer("10", correct = TRUE),
    answer("15"),
    answer("17")
  )
)
```

Let's now compare the number of variables to the number of columns:


```{r ch3-1e,exercise=TRUE}
# Use the dim() functions to get the number of rows and columns
```
```{r ch3-1e-hint-1}
# Use the dim() functions to get the number of rows and columns
dim(school_data_merged)
```
```{r ch3-1e-hint-2}
# Alternatively we can use the nrow() functions to get the number of columns
ncol(school_data_merged)
```



Oh no! The number of columns does not correspond to the number of variables. Let's sort this out. The issue is that the variables *test_year_5* contain information about the test score and the year. We need to separate this out. We can  use tools from the *tidyr* package to make the dataset tidy. Specifically, we use `pivot_longer()` which corresponds to *reshape long* in Stata.  See also section 9.2 in the [R introduction](https://hhsievertsen.shinyapps.io/r_introduction/)  for details. 

```{r ch3-1,eval=F, warning=F,include=T,echo=T}
# load tidyr package
library("tidyr")
# make data tidy (make long)
school_data_tidy<-school_data_merged%>%
       pivot_longer(
         cols = starts_with("test_year"),
         names_to = "year",
         names_prefix = "test_year_",
         names_transform = list(year = as.integer),
         values_to = "test_score",
       )
# ncol to get the number of columns of the new dataset
ncol(school_data_tidy)
```

```{r ch3-2,eval=T, warning=F,include=T,echo=F,message=FALSE}
ncol(school_data_tidy)
```


Hurray! We now have a dataset where the number columns correspond to the number of variables.

### 3.2 Sample Selection

We now have a dataset that satisfies the tidy data principles. The next task before  is the sample selection.  The only sample selection we are concerned with in this exercise is missing values. We will use the `skim()` function  to assess how many missing values there are in our dataset.  `skim()` is one of my favourite functions in R to get an overview of the datasets, it comes  from the *skimr* package. 


```{r ch3-3,exercise=TRUE}
# Load skimr
library("skimr")
# Use skim() to skim the data
skim(school_data_tidy)
```

 We can easily observe how many rows and columns there are, the variable types, the number of missing values. The mean, standard deviations, percentiles, and we even get a small histogram. 

We observe that the column *parental_schooling* has 45 missing values and the variable *test_score*  has 11 missing values. Let's assume that these values are missing at random and remove these rows. Here we use `filter()` for that. The `filter()` function takes two arguments. First, the name of the original dataset, and secondly the condition a row must satisfy to be kept in the filtering process. The condition we want to satisfy is that `!is.na(parental_schooling)`. The `is.na()` is a function is true if the element in `( )` is missing. We use the `!` to achieve the opposite of that. In other words that parental schooling is not missing. 


```{r ch3-4,exercise=TRUE}
# Select only rows with no missing values
school_data_selected<-filter(school_data_tidy,!is.na(parental_schooling),!is.na(test_score))
# Use skim() to skim the data again
skim(school_data_selected)
```

Very good! We've now created a new dataset containing only complete cases. Let's now create a nice looking table.


### 3.3 Modifying the data

Our next step is to make some modifications to the data. First, we will rename the *summercamp* variable to *summerschool*. We do that with the `rename()` function. The `rename()` function has a similar syntax to filter. We first state the name of the original dataset and then the rename expression.

```{r ch3-5,exercise=TRUE}
# rename summercamp to summerschool
analysisdata<-rename(school_data_selected, summerschool=summercamp)
# use head to view the first 6 observations 
head(analysisdata)
```

Brilliant. In the next step we want to transform our *test_score* variable to have mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. Importantly we want to do this standardization within year. In Stata this would be a task for *bys year:*. In Stata we first specify what variable to group the data on, and the apply the functions *sd* and *mean* on that level.


```{r ch3-6,exercise=TRUE}
# Standardize test score
# Group analysisdata by year
analysisdata<-group_by(analysisdata,year)
# Create a new variable with mutate
analysisdata<-mutate(analysisdata, test_score=(test_score-mean(test_score))/sd(test_score))
# show mean of test_score
print(paste("Mean of test score:",mean(analysisdata$test_score)))
#show sd of test_score
print(paste("SD of test score:",sd(analysisdata$test_score)))
```

In the example above we use 

- `print()` to print output to the console (just like *display* in Stata). 
- `paste()` to concatenate elements together
- `analysisdata$test_score` to extract the variable *test_score* from the *analysisdata* dataset.
- `mean()` and `sd()` to calculate means and standard deviations. Note that this only works because we already removed the missing values. If we apply `mean()` on a vector that includes missing values it will return a missing value unless we specify the option `na.rm = FALSE`. 


## 4 Descriptive Statistics 

We've now managed to load *csv*, *dta*, and *xlsx* files. We've also managed to merge them, restructure the dataset, and we have removed missing values. The next step in our empirical project is to create some tables and charts to describe the dataset. 

Our goal is to create a table that shows means, standard deviations, and other statistics that gives us and the reader an impression of the dataset. We already know at least two ways to calculate summary statistics:
  
1. `summary()` from base R. This function actually works on a lot of object types in R. It always gives a good summary. But our goal is to create a table that we can include in a Microsoft Word or Latex document. 

2. `skim()` from the *skimr* package. 

### 4.1 A quick way to create a nice looking table

We will first use a cousin of `skim()` to create a table with summary statistics that can be exported to various formats, included Latex. The cousin comes from the *modelsummary* package and is called `datasummary_skim()`. Let's first create the default table:

```{r ch4-1,exercise=T}
# load modelsummary
library("modelsummary")
# create a summary stat table
analysisdata%>%
  filter(year==2)%>%
  select(female,starts_with("paren"),letter,summerschool,test_score)%>%
  datasummary_skim()
```

Let's  change the appearance of the table and export it to Word.  When exporting it to Latex, we can't have histogram', so we disable them. We specify `output="docx"` to write to a Word file. We can also export the table to other formats like LaTex. 

```{r ch4-2,eval=F, warning=F,include=T,echo=T,results="asis",message=FALSE}
# load modelsummary
library("modelsummary")
# create a summary stat table in Latex format
analysisdata%>%
  filter(year==2)%>%
  select(female,starts_with("paren"),letter,summerschool,test_score)%>%
  datasummary_skim( fmt="%.2f",
                 histogram=FALSE, output="tab_summary_statistics.docx")
```

```{r ch4-2b,eval=T, warning=F,include=T,echo=F,message=FALSE}
# load modelsummary
library("modelsummary")
# create a summary stat table in Latex format
analysisdata%>%
  filter(year==2)%>%
  select(female,starts_with("paren"),letter,summerschool,test_score)%>%
  datasummary_skim( fmt="%.2f")
```

Brilliant. 




### 4.2 Custom tables 

To customize our table of summary statistics a bit more we can use the function `datasummary()` (from the modelsummary package, but we have already loaded that1). This function allows us to enter a *formula* for the structure of our table. Try running the code below and try  also to make a change to also include the 75th percentile and to include the *parental_lincome* variable. 

```{r merge3, exercise=TRUE,  warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# create a summary stat table
datasummary(female+parental_schooling+
              letter+test_score~Factor(summerschool)*(Mean+SD),
            sparse_header = FALSE,
            data=filter(analysisdata,year==2))
```

```{r merge3-hint-1}
# create a summary stat table
datasummary(female+parental_schooling+parental_lincome+
              letter+test_score~Factor(summerschool)*(Mean+SD+P75),
            sparse_header = FALSE,
            data=filter(analysisdata,year==2))
```



In the example above we

- List the variables to include separated with a +:`female+parental_schooling+pa...`

- Use a `~` to separate the list of variables from the formula.

- Use the formula `Factor(summerschool)*(Mean+SD)` to show that we want to show the mean and standard deviation separately for each values of the variable `summerschool`. We use `Factor()` to tell R that it should consider summerschool as a binary variable. We could also have done that in the data tidying process. We can also reverse the ordering `(Mean+SD)*Factor(summerschool)`, which would then first show the mean and standard deviation and then split by summerschool within these values. 

- Use `sparse_header = FALSE` to specify that we actually want to include the "summerschool" as a header. 




### 4.3 Variable names in tables

So far we've used variable names as labels in our table. In contrast to Stata, R allows for labels with white space, and we could therefore rename the variables to give nicer looking names in our table. However, we can also just assign a "label" when creating the table as shown below:

```{r ch4-5,eval=T, warning=F,include=T,echo=T,results="asis",message=FALSE}
# load modelsummary
library("modelsummary")
# create a summary stat table

datasummary((`Female`=female)+
            (`Parental schooling (years)`=parental_schooling)+
            (`Parental income (log)`=parental_lincome)+
            (`Received reminder letter`=letter)+
            (`Test Score`=test_score)~
            (`Attended summer school`=Factor(summerschool))*
              (Mean+SD),
            sparse_header = FALSE,
            data=filter(analysisdata,year==2))
```


### 4.4 Exporting our table to Microsoft Word 

To save our `datasummary()` table to Microsoft Word or Latex, we use the same expression as with `datasummary_skim()`, as illustrated below: 

```{r ch4-6,eval=F, warning=F,include=T,echo=T,results="asis",message=FALSE}
# load modelsummary
library("modelsummary")
# create a summary stat table
datasummary((`Female`=female)+
            (`Parental schooling (years)`=parental_schooling)+
            (`Parental income (log)`=parental_lincome)+
            (`Received reminder letter`=letter)+
            (`Test Score`=test_score)~
            (Mean+SD+P25+P50+P75),
            sparse_header = FALSE,
            data=filter(analysisdata,year==2),
            output = 'tab_descriptive_statistics.docx')
```





## 5 Descriptive charts

The *ggplot* world is covered in detail in [R introduction](https://hhsievertsen.shinyapps.io/r_introduction_UoB_2/), but let us briefly cover a few charts here as well. You will also see more charts in later chapters.



### 5.1 A scatter plot

Our first chart is a scatter plot. We are interested in whether test score and parental income are correlated. We therefore create a scatter plot of test scores in year 5 against parental income. We add a fitted line as well. 

In the following example we

1. Initiate a `ggplot()` object using the *analysisdata* filtered to only include year 5.
2. Specify that *parental_lincome*  should be used on the x-axis and *test_score* on the y-axis in  `aes()` inside `ggplot()`.
3. Use `geom_smooth()` to include a fitted line.
4. Use `geom_point()` to add the scatters.

This chart does not look very good. You can use the tools from the [R introduction](https://hhsievertsen.shinyapps.io/r_introduction_UoB_2/) to polish it (or you can use the hints to get some suggestions).


```{r merge4, exercise=TRUE,  warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# load ggplot2
library("ggplot2")
# create a scatter plot with a fitted line
ggplot(analysisdata%>%filter(year==5),  
       aes(x=parental_lincome,y=test_score))+
       geom_smooth() +
       geom_point()
```

```{r merge4-hint-1}
# Make the line green by setting the color to the html colour code "#145c21"

# load ggplot2
library("ggplot2")
# create a scatter plot with a fitted line
ggplot(analysisdata%>%filter(year==5),  
       aes(x=parental_lincome,y=test_score))+
       geom_smooth(color="#145c21") +
       geom_point()

```

```{r merge4-hint-2}
# Make the scatters green, partly transparent (with alpha=), and change the size of them.

# load ggplot2
library("ggplot2")
# create a scatter plot with a fitted line
ggplot(analysisdata%>%filter(year==5),

```

  labs(x="Log(Parental Income)",y="Test Score (Mean=0,SD=1)", title="Test scores & Parental income")

```



### 5.2 Bar chart and boxplot

Okay, we observe that test score is correlated with parental income. That is not surprising. Now let's also create charts to assesses whether summer school attendance is correlated with individual characteristics. We first create a scatter plot of parental schooling and test scores in year 5 (before the summer school). This is just like above, but with schooling instead of income. Secondly, we create a bar chart showing average test score in year 5 (before the summer school) by summer school attendance. Thirdly, we create box plots of parental income by summer school attendance. There are a few additional tricks in the following code:


- We first create the basic `ggplot()` object where we load the data and specify the theme. This object is called *rawchart*
- We then create 3 charts based on *rawchart*. Each chart is saved under a name.
- We use `geom_bar()` to create a bar chart. We set `stat="summary",fun="mean"` to tell R to create a bar chart showing the mean of *test_score*.
- We use `labs()` to specify the axes titles. 
- We use `geom_boxplot()` to create  a box plot.
- We use the patchwork package to combine several charts in one chart. 
- Use `ggsave()` to save the chart to a *png* file.




```{r ch5-2,eval=F, warning=F,include=T,echo=T,results="asis", out.width=600,fig.align="center"}
# Load patchwork 
library("patchwork")
# Create raw chart element
rawchart<-ggplot(analysisdata%>%filter(year==4),x=as.factor(fill))+
          theme_classic()

       geom_smooth(aes(x=parental_schooling,y=test_score)) +

       labs(x="Parental schooling", y="Test Score Year 5")
# Create bar chart of pre summer school test score and summer school 
p2<-rawchart+
       geom_bar(aes(x=as.factor(summerschool),y=test_score),

              geom_boxplot(aes(x=as.factor(summerschool),y=parental_lincome))+
       labs(y="Parental Income (log)", x="Attended Summer School")
# Combine charts

```
```{r ch5-3,eval=T, warning=F,message=F,include=T,echo=F,results="asis", out.width=600,fig.align="center"}
# Load patchwork

# Create raw chart element
rawchart<-ggplot(filter(analysisdata,year==4),x=as.factor(fill))+
          theme_classic()
# Create bar chart of pre summer school test score and summer school 
p1<-rawchart+
       geom_smooth(aes(x=parental_schooling,y=test_score)) +
       geom_point(aes(x=parental_schooling,y=test_score),alpha=0.1)+
       labs(x="Parental schooling", y="Test Score Year 5")
# Create bar chart of pre summer school test score and summer school 
p2<-rawchart+
       geom_bar(aes(x=as.factor(summerschool),y=test_score),
                    stat="summary",fun="mean")+
       labs(y="Test Score Year 5", x="Attended Summer School")
# Create bar chart of parental schooling and summer school attendance
p3<-rawchart+
              geom_boxplot(aes(x=as.factor(summerschool),y=parental_lincome))+
       labs(y="Parental Income (log)", x="Attended Summer School")
# Combine charts
p1/(p2+p3)
```

The three charts above show us that test scores are correlated with parental background (the scatter plot), that those who attended the summer school  had better test scores before the summer school, and  that parental account is correlated with summer school attendance (the box plot). In short:

```{r , echo=FALSE, fig.cap=" ", out.width = '40%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/selectionbias.png")
```

### 5.3  Histogram & density  charts
Let's compare the test score distribution in year 6 (after the summer school) for those who attended the summer school with those who did not. We create a histogram and add a line showing the estimated density distributions. In the hints we also change the colour scheme, the legend labels, the legend position, and do a few minor tweaks. 



```{r merge5, exercise=TRUE,  warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# create a histogram and density chart
ggplot(filter(analysisdata,year==6),
       aes(x=test_score,fill=as.factor(summerschool)))+
       geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..),bins = 50,alpha=0.5,
                       position="identity",color="white")+
       geom_density()
```

```{r merge5-hint-1}
# create a histogram and density chart
ggplot(filter(analysisdata,year==6),
       aes(x=test_score,fill=as.factor(summerschool)))+
       geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..),bins = 50,alpha=0.5,
                       position="identity",color="white")+
       geom_density(alpha=0.0,size=1,show.legend= FALSE)+
       theme_minimal()+
       labs(y="Density",x="Test score",fill=" ")+
       scale_fill_brewer(palette="Set2",labels=c("No summer school","Summer school"))+
       theme(legend.position="top")
  

```





### 5.4  The Joy Division Album Cover chart

```{r , echo=FALSE, fig.cap=" ", out.width = '40%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/joydivision.png")
```

The next chart is inspired by a Joy Division album cover unknown pleasures (read more [here](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/sa-visual/pop-culture-pulsar-origin-story-of-joy-division-s-unknown-pleasures-album-cover-video/)). We use ` geom_density_ridges()` from the *ggridges* package.

Our goal is to compare the test score distribution for those who received the summer school reminder letter with those who did not. We are already making a step into the next chapter and assessing at the Randomized Control Trial in two dimensions. First, the test score comparisons before year 6 are informative about whether the randomization worked. Secondly, the test score comparisons from year 6 and later are informative about the reduced form effect. 


```{r ch5-5,eval=T, warning=F,include=T,echo=T,results="asis",message=FALSE, out.width=750,fig.align='center'}
# Load ggridges
library("ggridges")

# create a ggridges  chart
ggplot(analysisdata,aes(y=as.factor(year),x=test_score,fill=as.factor(letter) ))+
        geom_density_ridges(  alpha = .7, scale=1.5,color = "white", from = -2.5, to = 2.5)+
        theme_minimal()+
        theme_ridges(grid = FALSE)+
  scale_y_discrete(expand = c(0, 0)) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +
        scale_fill_brewer(palette="Set1",labels=c("No letter","Letter"))+
        labs(x="Test Score",y="Year",fill=" ",
            title="Test score distribution by reminder letter status  & year")+
        theme(legend.position="top",aspect.ratio=4/3,plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
  
```

The chart above tells a convincing story. In the first five years the distribution of test scores is essentially identical across those who received and those who did not receive a reminder letter. That indicates that the randomisation worked as intended. After year 5 the test score distribution of those who received a reminder letter shifted to the right compared to those who did not receive a letter suggesting a reduced form effect of the letter on our outcome. Let's analyse that in the next sections. 




## 6 Balancing tables

The last chart suggested that the letter that was randomly sent to some families to remind them about the summer school worked. The test score distribution of the children that received the letter shifted to the right. Importantly, the charts also suggested that there was no difference prior to the summer school. Let us now test that formally. 

### 6.1 Pairwise t-test

We can conduct a t-test in R using `t.test()`. Specifically, we specify the formula `test_score~summerschool` to test whether the mean *test_score* is significantly different across the two groups specified by *summerschool*. Let's do that for year 5 data:



```{r merge6, exercise=TRUE,  warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Filter year 5
df<-analysisdata%>%filter(year==5)
# Conduct a t test
t.test(test_score~summerschool,data=df)
```




Note that  `df<-analysisdata%>%filter(year==5)` might look a bit unfamiliar to you. It simply a different way of writing `df<-filter(analysisdata,year==5)`. But what is the right interpretation of the test result?

```{r quiz2}
quiz(
  question("What is the correct interpretation of the test?",
    answer("The p-value is < 2.2e-16, and using a 5% significance level we therefore  reject the null hypothesis that the difference in means between those who attended and those who did not attend is zero. In other words, the test score before was significantly different across those who attended and those who did not attend." , correct = TRUE),
        answer("The p-value is < 2.2e-16, and using a 5% (or even higher) significance level we therefore cannot reject the null hypothesis that the difference in means between those who attended and those who did not attend is zero. In other words, the test score before was not significantly different across those who attended and those who did not attend."),
       answer("The p-value is 0.2082893 , and using a 5% (or even higher) significance level we therefore  reject the null hypothesis that the difference in means between those who attended and those who did not attend is zero. In other words, the test score before was significantly different across those who attended and those who did not attend.")
  )
)
```



One feature of R that I really appreciate (especially compared to Stata) is that I can skip steps and directly insert functions within other functions. For example if I know that I am not going to use the selected dataset again, we don't need to create it first. We can simply specify the selection criteria in the data argument of `t.test()` as shown by the hints to the code block above, where we use year 4 instead of year 5.



### 6.2 A publication ready table of mean comparisons

If we want to create a nice looking balancing table and insert it in Word, we can use `datasummary_balance()` from the *modelsummary* package. We load the *estimatr* package because it enables `datasummary_balance()` to calculate and include the pairwise t-tests directly into the table


```{r ch6-3,eval=T, warning=F,include=T,echo=T,results="asis",message=FALSE}
# Load libraries
library(modelsummary)
library(estimatr)
# Filter and modify data
testdata<-filter(analysisdata,year==5)
testdata<-ungroup(testdata)
testdata<-mutate(testdata,Treated=ifelse(letter==1,"Letter","No Letter"))
testdata<-select(testdata,female,parental_schooling,parental_lincome,test_score,Treated)
testdata<-rename(testdata,`Female`=female,
          `Parental schooling (years)`=parental_schooling,
          `Parental income (log)`=parental_lincome,
          `Test Score`=test_score)
     
# Table with balancing test
datasummary_balance(~Treated,
                    data = testdata,
                    title = "Balance of pre-treatment variables",
                    notes = "Notes: This is a brilliant table!",
                    fmt= '%.5f',
                    dinm_statistic = "p.value")


```
This looks nice!The table suggests that all variables are well balanced across treated (receiving a letter) and untreated. 

As before, we can simply add the option `output=tab_balancing.docx` if we want to export the table to Microsoft Word.




##  7 Ordinary Least Squares 


Our goal is now to estimate the following reduced form relationship between test score in year 6 and an indicator for receiving a reminder letter using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)

$testscore_i=\beta_0+\beta_1Letter_i+u_i$.



### 7.1 OLS estimation with with `lm()` 

We can run OLS  with `lm()` (linear models). We first enter a formula of the form:

- `y~x1+x2+...`

followed by the 

- `data=...` command.

Below is an example based on a univariate regression between testscore and the indicator for receiving the letter. Try to change the code to also include parental_lincome in the regression (see hints).

```{r merge7, exercise=TRUE,  warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Our first ordinary least squares regression
lm(test_score~letter,data=filter(analysisdata,year==6))
```

```{r merge7-hint-1}
# ... now also with parental_lincome
lm(test_score~letter+parental_lincome,data=filter(analysisdata,year==6))
```


The output from `lm()` is a bit disappointing.  But fear not. We can use the universal `summary()` function to get a bit more information out of `lm()`:


```{r merge8, exercise=TRUE,  warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Summary of ordinary least squares regression
summary(lm(test_score~letter,data=filter(analysisdata,year==6)))
```

```{r merge8-hint-1}
# ... now also with parental lincome
summary(lm(test_score~letter+parental_lincome,data=filter(analysisdata,year==6)))
```


A nice feature of R is that we can assign basically everything to a name and then use it later. In the code block below we first run a regression and store it under the name *model1*. We then later call these regression results back when using the `summary()` command (see hints!). In the following example we include a few covariates in the regression: 


```{r merge9, exercise=TRUE,  warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#  Ordinary Least Squares regression
model1<-lm(test_score~parental_schooling+parental_lincome+letter+female,data=filter(analysisdata,year==6))

```

```{r merge9-hint-1}
#  Ordinary Least Squares regression
model1<-lm(test_score~parental_schooling+parental_lincome+letter+female,data=filter(analysisdata,year==6))
# Summary of model1
summary(model1)
```


### 7.2 OLS with the feols() function

I am a big fan of running regressions with **reghdfe** if in Stata. Luckily R has something quite similar. That is `feols()` from the *fixest* package. This function expects a formula of the form:

- `y~x1+x2+..|fixed effects|IV specification,cluster=..`

In the following example we run a linear regression without fixed effects, but standard errors clustered on the school level. 

```{r ch7-4,eval=T, warning=F,include=T,echo=T,message=FALSE}
# Load packages
library(fixest)
# Select data
regdata<-filter(analysisdata,year==6)
# Regression
m1<-feols(test_score~letter+parental_lincome+female+parental_schooling, cluster="school_id",data=regdata)
# Summary of regression
summary(m1)
```
```{r regdata}
# Select data
regdata<-filter(analysisdata,year==6)
```

Brilliant. Let's now try to output such regressions to a nice looking table. We use the `modelsummary()` function from *modelsummary* for that. In the following example we


1. Run two regressions and store them as *models* in a list. The first regression is above, in the second regression we add fixed effects for year and school.

2. Use `modelsummary()` to output the results of the regression results stored in *models*.

3. Specify that `modelsummary()` excludes the coefficient on the intercept.

4. Specify that parentheses should include standard errors with `statistic='std.error'`.

5. Specify the formatting of the numbers with `fmt=..`.




```{r merge10, exercise=TRUE,  warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,exercise.setup = "regdata"}
# Load  modelsummary
library(modelsummary)

# Regressions
models<-list(
  m1<-feols(test_score~letter+parental_lincome+female+parental_schooling, cluster="school_id",data=regdata),
  m2<-feols(test_score~letter+parental_lincome+female+parental_schooling|school_id+year, cluster="school_id",data=regdata)
  )
# Generate table
modelsummary(models, stars = TRUE,statistic = 'std.error',
             fmt= '%.4f',
              coef_omit= '(Intercept)')
```

Just like in earlier examples, we can output our table to Microsoft Word or Latex with `output=..`. The results show that those received a letter have a 0.2SD higher test score in year 6. There are many other settings that we can specify to polish our table. But let us  move on.




## 8 Logit & probit

Okay, from section 6 we conclude that the randomization worked and that receiving the letter is as good as random. From section 7 we know that those that received a letter have a 0.2SD higher test score in year 6. But that is the intend to treat effect. Let us now scale that by the first stage effect. We are interested in the link between receiving a letter and attending the summer school: 

$$summerschool_i=g(letter_i)$$



### 8.1 Estimating the LPM with OLS

Let us first consider the linear probability model and estimate

$$summerschool_i=\beta1+\beta_2letter_i+\gamma'X_i+u_i$$

We already know how to do that. We can use `lm()` or `felm()`, but let us use this as a change to add a row with the mean of the dependent variable. We do that by calculating the statistics we want to add and add them to the table with `add_rows=...` as shown below. 


```{r ch8-1,exercise=T,exercise.setup = "regdata"}
# Estimate LPM (the first stage)
models<-list(
  m1<-feols(summerschool ~letter, cluster="school_id",data=regdata),
  m2<-feols(summerschool ~letter+parental_schooling+parental_lincome+female| school_id+year,cluster="school_id",data=regdata)
  )
# Store the mean of dependent variable in a data frame
added_stats<-tibble("Mean of Dep. ",m1=mean(regdata$summerschool),m2=mean(regdata$summerschool))
# Generate table
modelsummary(models, stars = TRUE,statistic = 'std.error',  
             fmt= '%.4f',add_rows = added_stats,
              coef_omit= '(Intercept)')
```

So receiving the letter increases the likelihood of attending the summer school by 44% which is a about a 100% increase compared to the mean of 0.46.

### 8.2 Logit & Probit

We might not be happy with the linear probability model and decide to go for a logit or probit instead. Let's have a look at that.
We can use `glm()` to estimate logit and probit models. We specify the link function as an option as shown below for probit. 


```{r merge11, exercise=TRUE,  warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,exercise.setup = "regdata"}
#  Estimate a binary outcomes model using a probit
probit_results <- glm(summerschool ~letter, data = regdata, family = binomial(link="probit"))
# Print the results
summary(probit_results)
```

```{r merge11-hint-1}
# ... now a the logit: we simply change the link to "logit"

##  Estimate a binary outcomes model using a logit
logit_results <- glm(summerschool ~letter+parental_lincome+female+parental_schooling, data = regdata, family = binomial(link="logit"))
# Print the results
summary(logit_results)
```


Try to change the code above to get the logit estimates (see hints!). Let's compute the average marginal effects.

### 8.3 Marginal effects

We can use `margins()` to obtain average marginal effects. We simply use the `margins()` function on the objects storing or probit and logit estimates. We can also include these directly in a nice looking table. 


```{r ch8-4,eval=T, warning=F,include=T,echo=T,message=FALSE}
# Load margins package
library("margins")
# Select data
regdata<-filter(analysisdata,year==6)
##  Estimate a binary outcomes model using a logit and probit
logit_results <- glm(summerschool ~letter+parental_lincome+female+parental_schooling, data = regdata, family = binomial(link="logit"))
probit_results <- glm(summerschool ~letter+parental_lincome+female+parental_schooling, data = regdata, family = binomial(link="probit"))
# Estimate linear probability model
lpm<-feols(summerschool ~letter+parental_schooling+parental_lincome+female, cluster="school_id",data=regdata)
#  Compute marginal effects
mfx_logit<- margins(logit_results)
mfx_probit<- margins(probit_results)
# Include in table
modelsummary(list("LPM"=lpm,"Logit"=mfx_logit,"Probit"=mfx_probit))
```

The results are very similar across the columns, and we will proceed with the LPM in a two stage least squares approach to estimate the IV.




## 9 Instrumental Variables

We estimated the reduced form relationship between receiving a reminder letter and test scores to be 0.2SD. We have also estimated the first stage to be around 0.4. What does this mean for the IV estimator (hint: use the Wald Estimator)? 


```{r quiz3}
quiz(
  question("Given the reduced form estimate of 0.2SD and a first stage coefficient of 0.4, the IV estimate is expected to be",
    answer("About 0.5  based on dividing the reduced form estimate of 0.2 by the first stage of 0.4.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("About 0.08  based on multiplying the reduced form estimate of 0.2 by the first stage of 0.4."),
    answer("About 0.2, because it is always the same as the reduced form")
  )
)
```


Let us estimate the instrumental variable specification explicitly to see whether it maps with our answer above. I will show you two methods. 

### 9.1 IV using the  ivreg() function. 

We first use the `ivreg()` function from the *AER* package. AER does not refer to the American Economic Review, but to Applied Economics with R. The syntax is as follows

- `ivreg(outcome equation| exogenous variables, data)`

```{r ch9-1,eval=T, warning=F,include=T,echo=T,message=FALSE}
# Load the AER package
library(AER)
# Select data
regdata<-filter(analysisdata,year==6)
# Estimate IV specification with
summary(ivreg(test_score~summerschool+female+parental_lincome+parental_schooling|
                         female+parental_lincome+parental_schooling+letter,data=regdata))
```
The estimate is very close to the 0.5 we obtained above at 0.46SD.  

### 9.2 IV using the  feols() function. 

Let us now reuse the `feols()` function. Just like we can use *reghdfe* in Stata for IV, `felm()` also allows us to estimate IV specifications. We don't include fixed effect, so we simply set this part to 0. We then add a new part with the first stag 


```{r ch9-2,eval=T, warning=F,include=T,echo=T,message=FALSE}

# Estimate IV specification with felm 
m1<-feols(test_score~parental_lincome+female+parental_schooling| # Outcome eq.
           0|                                                    # Fixed effects
           summerschool~letter                                   # First stage
           ,cluster="school_id"                                  # Cluster var
            ,data=regdata)
# Summary of results
summary(m1)
```

The coefficients are as above, but note that the standard errors are slightly different now, as we cluster them on the school level. Note also that `feols()` tells us that the F-stat on the excluded instrument is 686.




### 9.3 A complete IV table

Let us finish the IV section by creating a complete IV table showing the raw correlation between test score and summer school attendance, the reduced form, the first stage, and the IV estimate. 

Note that in the example below we use `coef_map=` to rename coefficients, specify the coefficients to include, and to let two coefficients with different names appear in the same row (*summerschool* and *fit_summerschool* ).

Note that in the code block below I included a few "REPLACEME". The code will not work unless you change them to the right code. 


```{r merge12, exercise=TRUE,  warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,exercise.setup = "regdata"}
# Estimate OLS
OLS<-feols(test_score~summerschool+parental_lincome+female+parental_schooling,cluster="school_id",data=regdata)
# Estimate reduced form 
RF<-feols(REPLACEME~letter+parental_lincome+female+parental_schooling,cluster="school_id",data=regdata)
# Estimate first stage 
FS<-feols(REPLACEME~letter+parental_lincome+female+parental_schooling,cluster="school_id",data=regdata)
# Estimate IV specification 
IV<-feols(test_score~parental_lincome+female+parental_schooling| # Outcome eq.

The first column shows that ignoring the selection problem and estimating the relationship between test score and summer school conditional controls, leads to a coefficient of 0.78SD. As expected this coefficient is larger than the IV estimate of 0.47SD shown in the fourth column of the table. The descriptive charts in chapter 5 suggested that the children who attended the summer school already had better test scores before the summer school and that their parents have higher incomes and completed more years of education. The coefficient in the first column above is therefore likely capturing not only the causal effect of the summer school but also other unobserved characteristics that are positively linked to test scores and summer school attendance. 




##  10 Difference-in-Differences


Our IV story analysis was quite convincing. It is based on an RCT and the coefficient was smaller than the "naive OLS" as we expected. But let us not stop there. Let us also exploit that we have test scores of the children both before and after the summer school. We can therefore estimate a difference-in-differences specification:

$$test_score=\beta1+\beta_2summerschool_i+\beta_3after_i+\beta_4after_i\times summerschool+\gamma'X_i+u_i$$

Where after refers to test scores after attending the summer school. 

###  10.1 Inspecting the common trends

A crucial assumption behind the difference-in-differences approach is that the treated and control groups would have similar developments over time in the absence of treatment. We therefore want to create line charts of test scores over year to see whether the trends are similar in years without treatment. 

We use this as a change to first collapse the data on the year times summerschool level using `group_by()` and `summarise()`. There are a few "REPLACEME"s that you need to replace in order to make the code run. Hint: check the hints if you are stuck!


```{r merge14, exercise=TRUE,  warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,exercise.setup = "regdata"}
# Collapse data on the year X summer school level
df<-XYZ1(analysisdata,year,summerschool)
# Calculate the mean test score by year
df<-XYZ2(df,test_score=mean(test_score))
# Create a chart
ggplot(df,XYZ3(x=year,y=test_score,color=as.factor(summerschool)))+
  geom_line(size=1)+
  theme_classic()+
  theme(legend.position = "top")

```

```{r merge14-hint-1}
# Collapse data on the year X summer school level
df<-group_by(analysisdata,year,summerschool)
# Calculate the mean test score by year
df<-summarise(df,test_score=mean(test_score))
# Create a chart
ggplot(df,aes(x=year,y=test_score,color=as.factor(summerschool)))+
  geom_line(size=1)+
  theme_classic()+
  theme(legend.position = "top")

```



We observe a small drop in the treatment group just before the summer school and a small increase in the control group. That looks a bit worrying, but otherwise the trends are very similar. 

### 10.2 Estimating the Difference-in-Differences model


Let's estimate the simple difference-in-differences model using only data on year 5 and year 6 with the `lm()` function. We first modify the data to create an after indicator, using `mutate()` and `ifelse()`. 

```{r ch10-2,eval=T, warning=F,include=T,echo=T,message=FALSE}
# Select  year 5 and year 6 observations
df<-analysisdata%>%filter(year%in%c(5,6))
# Generate an after indicator and the interaction between after and summer school
df<-mutate(df,after=ifelse(year==6,1,0),afterXsumerschool=after*summerschool)
# Estimate the DiD regression and save the results in an element called m1
m<-lm(test_score~summerschool+after+afterXsumerschool,data=df)
# Print the results
summary(m)

```

Very good. We observe that the difference-in-differences coefficient is 0.75. Suggesting that attending the summer school increases the test scores by 0.75SD. That is  larger than the estimate we got above with the IV approach. Maybe it is because we only use year 5 and 6 and we saw this odd trend going from year 5 to year 6. Let's therefore try to add all years. 


We will  use the `feols()` function to estimate the the difference-in-differences specification on all years (we could also use `lm()`).  The first approach is the traditional approach with after, after X treated, and treated indicators. In the second approach we include year fixed effects instead of the after dummy. In the third approach we add controls. 

Note that I again added a few "REPLACEME" that you need to change before the code will run. Don't worry, you can always check the hints.


```{r merge13, exercise=TRUE,  warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,exercise.setup = "regdata"}
# Modify data
df<-mutate(analysisdata,after=ifelse(year>5,1,0),afterXsummerschool=after*summerschool)
df<-rename(df,school=summerschool)
# Estimate DiD without controls and fixed effects
m1<-feols(test_score~school+REPLACEME+after,cluster="school_id",data=df)
# Estimate DiD without controls
m2<-feols(test_score~school+afterXsummerschool|school_id+year,cluster="school_id",data=df)
# Estimate DiD  with controls
m3<-feols(test_score~afterXsummerschool+school+parental_lincome+female+parental_schooling
         |school_id+year,cluster="school_id",data=df)
# Leave year 5 out to avoid dip
m4<-feols(test_score~afterXsummerschool+school+parental_lincome+REPLACEME+parental_schooling
         |school_id+year,cluster="school_id",data=filter(df,year!=5))

# Coefficients
cm <- c('afterXsummerschool'  = 'Summer School X After',
        'school'        = 'Summer School',
        'after'='After')
# Output Table
modelsummary(list(m1,m2,m3,m4), stars = TRUE,statistic = 'std.error',  
             statistic_override = vcov,
             fmt= '%.4f',coef_map=cm)
```

```{r merge13-hint-1}

df<-mutate(analysisdata,after=ifelse(year>5,1,0),afterXsummerschool=after*summerschool)
df<-rename(df,school=summerschool)
# Estimate DiD without controls and fixed effects
m1<-feols(test_score~school+afterXsummerschool+after,cluster="school_id",data=df)
# Estimate DiD without controls
m2<-feols(test_score~school+afterXsummerschool|school_id+year,cluster="school_id",data=df)
# Estimate DiD  with controls
m3<-feols(test_score~afterXsummerschool+school+parental_lincome+female+parental_schooling
         |school_id+year,cluster="school_id",data=df)
# Leave year 5 out to avoid dip
m4<-feols(test_score~afterXsummerschool+school+parental_lincome+female+parental_schooling
         |school_id+year,cluster="school_id",data=filter(df,year!=5))

# Coefficients
cm <- c('afterXsummerschool'  = 'Summer School X After',
        'school'        = 'Summer School',
        'after'='After')
# Output Table
modelsummary(list(m1,m2,m3,m4), stars = TRUE,statistic = 'std.error',  
             statistic_override = vcov,
             fmt= '%.4f',coef_map=cm )
```


The treatment effects estimate are all around 0.6SD, which is slightly larger than the IV estimate, but smaller than the "naive OLS. The last column above shows the DiD estimate excluding year 5 where we observe the worrying deviations from the trend. As expected, this specification gives a slightly smaller coefficient of 0.54SD, it is however, still slightly larger than our IV estimate.
